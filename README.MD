This is a project meant to automate casual minecraft tasks with computers

MOD: CC:Tweaks(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked)

Currently I tried to automate cutting trees, which I achieved somehow, but the programm is buggy and unpolished

How to use it:
1. Download the project
2. Upload the files to pastebin
3. Copy the pastebin's link (pastebin.com/XXXXXXXXX)
4. Go to the turtle and type "pastebin get XXXXXXXXX filename" for every file
5. run Main.lua by typing main
6. Follow the instructions by the programm
