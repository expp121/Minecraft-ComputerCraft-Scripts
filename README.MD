This is a project meant to automate casual minecraft tasks with computers

MOD: CC:Tweaks(https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-tweaked)

Currently I tried to automate cutting trees, which I achieved somehow, but the programm is buggy and unpolished
#How I did setup my tree farm:
#	1.First of all I also used another mod: Botania for the collection of items on the ground: Flower -hopperhock (maybe in the future I will try to implement automatic fallen item collection, but now I am to lazy to think how to do it)
#	2.The flowers are next to the chest so the fallen saplings go into the chest
#	3.And when the turte runs out of saplings goes to the chest to restock(the restocking function is currently not working, so you have to manually refill with saplings)

How to use it:
1. Download the project
2. Upload the files to pastebin
3. Copy the pastebin's link (pastebin.com/XXXXXXXXX)
4. Go to the turtle and type "pastebin get XXXXXXXXX filename" for every file
5. run Main.lua by typing main
6. Follow the instructions by the programm
